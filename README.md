# vuejs-list-filter-modal

A small VueJS application based on a tutorial I wrote that can be found here: http://michaelsoriano.com/vuejs-lets-build-real-world-app/.

The app has items that shows up in a list. This list can be filtered by categories in the left sidebar. A modal box shows up once each item is clicked. 

Requires VueJS - and uses some jQuery for AJAX and other utilities. Bootstrap CSS is also used for styling.
